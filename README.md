# SonicMarioKirbyMechanics
A Unity3D project that teaches you how to make simple iconic mechanics from the games Sonic, Mario and Kirby.
The 'SonicMarioScene' contains ring/item pickups, damage spikes, breakable mario blocks and a mushroom pickup with powerup mechanics implemented.
The 'KirbyScene' contains vacuum mechanics, floating and projectile mechanics and basic absorption mechanics implemented.
All the visual assets were created with Blender.
